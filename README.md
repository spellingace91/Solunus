# Solunus
Solunus is a simple web application that gives you the rising and setting times for the sun and moon on the current day from your current location.

## How to use
Open your web browser to http://www.solun.us and allow your location to be used.

While the times are shown for the current day, if the moon sets after 11:59pm on the current day, the time shown is actually for the next day. This is to avoid confusion when the moon already set earlier that morning before rising again in the afternoon, since it usually doesn't do much good to know that the moon already set.
